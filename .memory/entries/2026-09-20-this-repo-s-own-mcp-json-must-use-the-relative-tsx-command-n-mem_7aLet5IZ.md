`memory connect` defaults to registering the absolute path of the running CLI, which is correct for a consuming project (works regardless of install method) but wrong for this repo, whose .mcp.json is committed and self-referencing — an absolute path would hardcode one machine's Documents folder and break for anyone who clones. Re-run as `memory connect --command "npx tsx apps/cli/src/cli.ts mcp"` after any connect here. Discovered by running plain `memory connect` in this repo and watching it rewrite the portable config to a local absolute path.

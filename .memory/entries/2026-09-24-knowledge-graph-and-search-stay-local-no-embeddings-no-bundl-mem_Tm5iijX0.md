The viewgraph command and the new MCP relationship/search tools had to satisfy a spec asking for 'semantic search' and 'automatic relevance ranking' while the README guarantees zero network calls and rejects AI-powered checks as costly/unreliable. Resolved (user's explicit choice among presented options) by keeping everything local: search_memory now ranks with a hand-rolled TF-IDF-style scorer (src/core/search.ts) instead of embeddings, and get_related_memory (src/core/graph.ts) finds connections via shared refs/tags/supersedes instead of vector similarity. The graph itself (buildGraph) is derived from listEntries() on every call, not cached, so 'incremental updates' fall out for free with no invalidation logic. viewgraph's interactive page (src/generators/graphHtml.ts) is a hand-rolled force-directed layout in vanilla JS embedded as a template string, not d3/vis-network, so the generated HTML has zero external script tags and whyanchor gains zero new npm dependencies. Rejected: cloud embeddings (breaks 'no network calls'), a bundled local embedding model (adds a heavy dependency + first-run download to a 6-dependency tool), and a CDN-loaded graph library (breaks offline use and the self-contained-file guarantee). Also caught in browser testing: the page's initial fitToView() must tolerate a zero-size SVG rect on first frame (retried via requestAnimationFrame) and re-fit on window resize until the user manually pans/zooms/drags — otherwise the graph can render at scale(0) and look blank depending on when the browser finishes layout.

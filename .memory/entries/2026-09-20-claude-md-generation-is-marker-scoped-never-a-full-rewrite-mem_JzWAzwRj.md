upsertMemorySection only replaces the text between <!-- ctx-memory:start --> and <!-- ctx-memory:end -->, so hand-written instructions elsewhere in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md survive every regeneration. Marker lookup now matches only lines that are exactly the marker, not any substring — the original indexOf-based search matched the literal marker text when an entry's own body mentioned it (e.g. this entry describing the marker itself), truncating the file mid-sentence and duplicating content on every regenerate. Caught by dogfooding: capturing this exact entry corrupted CLAUDE.md the first time.

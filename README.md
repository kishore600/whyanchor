# whyanchor

**Your AI coding agent forgets why your code is the way it is. This remembers for it.**

A small command-line tool that stores project decisions as markdown files in your git repo, feeds
them to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) at the right moment, and warns you when a note no
longer matches the code it describes.

No account. No network calls. Everything lives in your repo. The one exception is `whyanchor
viewgraph`, which starts a local web server on your machine to power its UI — nothing leaves your
machine, but it is a real server, not just files. Every other command stays exactly as local as
that sounds.

## The problem

Here is the whole problem in one story.

You set the enterprise discount to **30%**. You did that because **Legal signed a contract that
requires 30%** — not because it felt right.

```ts
if (tier === "enterprise") return total * 0.3;
```

Six months later, someone opens this file. Maybe a new teammate. Maybe an AI agent in a fresh
session that knows nothing about last year. They see `0.3` and think:

> "Let's try 0.35 for the Q4 push."

The code does not say why. `git blame` says *"update pricing."* Nobody remembers. The contract
gets broken by a one-character change.

**The reason was never written anywhere the next person would actually look.**

This happens constantly with AI agents, because every new session starts with zero memory of the
last one. You explain the same constraint again and again — and the one time you forget to, the
agent quietly undoes a decision you made on purpose.

---

## What this tool does

Three jobs, nothing more:

| # | Job | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Remember** a decision | One command (`whyanchor capture`) writes it to a markdown file in your repo. Your agent can also write one itself, mid-conversation. |
| 2 | **Deliver** it to the agent at the right time | Two ways: written into the files agents read at startup (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Cursor's rules file), and served live over MCP so the agent can ask "what do I need to know about *this* file?" |
| 3 | **Keep it honest** | `whyanchor check` compares each note against the code it points at. If the code moved on, the note gets flagged. |

Job 3 is the important one. Every "write down your decisions" system dies the same way: the notes
rot, somebody gets burned by a wrong answer, and the team stops trusting the whole thing. A note
that tells you when it has gone out of date is the difference between a tool that lasts and one
that gets abandoned in month two.

---

## Architecture

Everything is files in your git repo. There is no database, and no server apart from the optional,
local-only `viewgraph` UI. This is the end-to-end picture — [the day-to-day workflow](#the-day-to-day-workflow) below zooms into each arrow one at a
time.

![End-to-end architecture: you and your agent both write to .memory/entries, whyanchor generate rolls it into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/Cursor rules, and whyanchor check compares notes against git history](docs/diagrams/architecture.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/architecture.mmd)</sub>

Following the numbers:

1. **A decision gets written down** — either you run one command, or the agent saves the note
   itself while you are working with it.
2. **Notes are rolled into the files agents already read** — `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   and Cursor's own rules file. One command writes all three.
3. **The agent gets the note two ways** — passively at startup from that file, and actively over
   MCP when it wants to know about one specific file it is editing.
4. **The tool checks its own notes against reality** — comparing the saved fingerprint to the
   current code and git history, and flagging the ones that no longer match.

---

## Install

Requires **Node.js 20.9+** (the bundled graph UI runs on Next.js 16) and **git**. whyanchor is
published on npm — there is nothing to clone or build.

```bash
npx whyanchor init
```

Run that inside a git repo you actually work in. `npx` fetches the tool on first use, so this
works with zero setup. If you'd rather have `whyanchor` on your PATH permanently:

```bash
npm install -g whyanchor
whyanchor init
```

Every example in this README is written as `whyanchor <command>`. If you skipped the global
install, prefix each one with `npx `.

---

## Use it in 5 minutes

Go to any git repo you actually work in:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
whyanchor init      # creates .memory/ to hold your notes
whyanchor connect   # wires the tool into Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex
```

That is the entire setup. `init` creates `.memory/` (with a `.gitkeep`, so the empty store survives
being committed and cloned). `whyanchor connect` writes the config files your agents need and adds a
short instruction block to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` telling the agent when to use it. It
**merges** into any config you already have — it never overwrites other MCP servers, and if it
cannot understand a config file it leaves that one untouched, reports it, and still sets up the
other agents.

Now save your first decision. Just run the command with no flags — it asks you the questions:

```bash
whyanchor capture
```

```
√ One-line title for this memory:
  Enterprise discount is 30% by contract, not a guess

√ What should future you (or another dev) know? (a few sentences)
  Legal signed off on 30% in the 2026 MSA template. Do not change this for conversion
  experiments without contract review.

√ Files/symbols this is anchored to (comma-separated, e.g. src/billing.ts#calculateTax)
  src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount

√ Tags (comma-separated, optional)
  pricing, legal

✔ Captured "Enterprise discount is 30% by contract, not a guess" → .memory/entries/2026-09-21-enterprise-discount-is-30-by-contract-not-a-guess-mem_a8AwCAoR.md
```

The third question — **anchoring** the note to `src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount` — is the part
that matters most. That anchor is what makes staleness detection possible later. If a file doesn't
exist, or a symbol can't be found in it, `capture` still saves the note but tells you so.

Same flow, a second time, anchored to a real file in a feature folder rather than the pricing
toy example — this is what it looks like day to day:

```
√ One-line title for this memory: ... Auth routes require a signed session cookie, not a bearer token
√ What should future you (or another dev) know? (a few sentences) ... We standardized on cookie-based sessions for browser routes; bearer tokens are reserved for the mobile client. Do not add Authorization-header parsing here without checking with the mobile team first.
√ Files/symbols this is anchored to (comma-separated, e.g. src/billing.ts#calculateTax): ... src/features/auth/auth.router.ts
√ Tags (comma-separated, optional): ... auth,routes
```

Finally, push it into the files your agents read at startup:

```bash
whyanchor generate
```

Now open that project in Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex. Ask it to change the discount. It will
already know why it is 30%.

### Which file does each agent read?

`whyanchor generate` writes three files, because the tools do not agree on one:

| File | Read by | Why this file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | Claude Code reads a project CLAUDE.md from either the repo root or `.claude/`; this keeps the root clean |
| `AGENTS.md` | **Codex**, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Zed and others | The vendor-neutral standard, now stewarded under the Linux Foundation and used by 60k+ projects |
| `.cursor/rules/whyanchor.mdc` | Cursor | Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` too, but this is its *native* rules format, which supports per-file scoping |

Two things worth knowing, because the naming trips people up:

- **There is no `Codex.md`.** Codex reads `AGENTS.md`. That file already covers it.
- **There is no `Cursor.md`.** Cursor uses `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files, and the `.mdc` extension is
  required — a plain `.md` file dropped in that folder is silently ignored, because Cursor needs
  the YAML frontmatter to know when to apply the rule.
- **Don't keep a root `CLAUDE.md` as well.** Claude Code loads `./CLAUDE.md` *and*
  `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` when both exist, so a leftover root copy injects every note twice and
  wastes context. `whyanchor generate` warns you if it spots one.

Generate just one if you prefer:

```bash
whyanchor generate --target claude   # only .claude/CLAUDE.md
whyanchor generate --target agents   # only AGENTS.md
whyanchor generate --target cursor   # only the Cursor rules file
whyanchor generate --target all      # all three (the default)
```

### Tuning the Cursor rule

The `.mdc` file is created with frontmatter that applies it to every request:

```yaml
---
description: Project memory — decisions and the reasoning behind them, captured with whyanchor
alwaysApply: true
---
```

If your memory grows large and you only want it loaded for certain files, edit that frontmatter —
swap `alwaysApply: true` for a `globs` pattern:

```yaml
---
description: Project memory
globs: ["src/billing/**", "src/pricing.ts"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

Your edits to the frontmatter are preserved. `whyanchor generate` only rewrites the notes below it.

---

## The day-to-day workflow

`init` and `connect` are one-time setup. Everything below is what actually recurs, week to week.

| When | What you run | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| You just made a decision someone could undo by accident | `whyanchor capture` | ~20 seconds, interactive by default |
| Mid-conversation with an agent | Nothing — the agent calls `capture_memory` itself | That's the point of wiring up MCP |
| After a batch of captures, or before opening the project in your agent | `whyanchor generate` | Rolls new notes into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / Cursor's rules file |
| Right before you commit | `whyanchor check` (or the git hook below) | Catches notes that silently went stale because of this change |
| A note comes back `[STALE]` | `whyanchor capture --supersedes <id>` | Writes a corrected note; the old one stays in `.memory/entries/` with its status flipped to `superseded` — its text is never rewritten |

The five diagrams below cover, respectively: the loop above end to end, then each of its steps in
more detail — how a note gets written, how it gets back out to an agent (two different ways), and
how an agent finds it during a conversation.

### Developer workflow flow

![Developer workflow flow: capture a decision, generate, check before committing, supersede if a note goes stale](docs/diagrams/developer-workflow-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/developer-workflow-flow.mmd)</sub>

### Memory capture flow

What actually happens inside `whyanchor capture`, whether you answer the prompts or pass flags:

![Memory capture flow: whyanchor capture reads git author and commit, fingerprints each anchored ref, and writes a markdown file to .memory/entries](docs/diagrams/memory-capture-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/memory-capture-flow.mmd)</sub>

Nothing here touches git itself — the file is written and left staged-or-not, exactly like any
other change you made by hand. You review and commit it the same way.

### Context injection flow

What `whyanchor generate` does to get a note in front of an agent that has no MCP support (or
before it has even started a session):

![Context injection flow: whyanchor generate groups notes by tag and upserts them between markers in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and the Cursor rules file](docs/diagrams/context-injection-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/context-injection-flow.mmd)</sub>

The replacement is marker-scoped and line-exact, not a full-file rewrite — so a hand-written note
above the block, or a note whose own body happens to contain marker-like text, cannot corrupt the
file. If a marker has gone missing or been duplicated (a bad merge, an accidental delete), `generate`
refuses to touch that file and says why, rather than guessing which lines are generated and deleting
yours. The file keeps its own line endings (a CRLF file stays CRLF), and each note is listed once,
under its first tag.

### MCP integration flow

What `whyanchor connect` sets up, and what happens live once the agent is running:

![MCP integration flow: whyanchor connect registers the server and usage instructions, then the agent spawns whyanchor mcp and calls its tools during a conversation](docs/diagrams/mcp-integration-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/mcp-integration-flow.mmd)</sub>

By default `connect` registers the absolute path of the whyanchor it was run with (`node
/path/to/whyanchor/dist/cli.js mcp`), which stays valid on that machine for a global install or a
source checkout. When it's run through `npx whyanchor` (or `pnpm dlx` / `bunx`), that path is a
temporary cache that gets pruned, so `connect` registers `npx -y whyanchor mcp` instead — wrapped in
`cmd /c` on Windows, where MCP clients can't launch npx's `.cmd` shim directly. If you commit these
configs for a team, pick a command that works on everyone's machine and pass it with `--command`
(quotes are honored, e.g. `--command "node \"C:\Program Files\wa\cli.js\" mcp"`).

### Memory retrieval flow

Five different ways a note comes back out of `.memory/entries/`, depending on who's asking:

![Memory retrieval flow: five ways a note comes back out of .memory/entries, via whyanchor list, whyanchor check, or the agent's MCP tools](docs/diagrams/memory-retrieval-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/memory-retrieval-flow.mmd)</sub>

### Run the check automatically

Put this in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and make it executable:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
whyanchor check --fail-on-stale || {
  echo "Some memory notes look stale — run 'whyanchor check' to see them."
  exit 1
}
```

`--fail-on-stale` exits with code `1` when something is flagged — or when an entry file can't be
read at all (say, a merge conflict in its frontmatter), since that note can't be checked either — so
it also works as a CI step. Every command skips an unreadable entry with a warning naming the file,
rather than failing outright.

---

## All commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `whyanchor init` | Creates `.memory/` in the current git repo. Run once per project. |
| `whyanchor connect` | Registers the tool with Claude Code, Cursor and Codex, and writes agent instructions into `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. |
| `whyanchor capture` | Saves a new decision. Interactive, or scripted with flags. |
| `whyanchor generate` | Writes your notes into `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.cursor/rules/whyanchor.mdc`. |
| `whyanchor check` | Compares every note against the current code. Reports what has gone stale. |
| `whyanchor list` | Shows all saved notes. |
| `whyanchor viewgraph` | Starts a local web app rendering your notes, files and tags as an interactive graph, and opens it in your browser. |
| `whyanchor mcp` | Runs the MCP server. **Agents run this, not you.** |

Useful flags:

```bash
whyanchor capture --supersedes mem_ab12cd34   # replace an outdated note
whyanchor check --fail-on-stale               # exit 1 if stale (for CI / git hooks)
whyanchor check --json                        # machine-readable output
whyanchor check --write                       # save the check result into the note files
whyanchor generate --target cursor            # only one target: claude | agents | cursor | all
whyanchor list --tag pricing                  # filter by tag
whyanchor viewgraph --tag pricing             # pre-filter the graph to one tag
whyanchor viewgraph --port 5000               # run the graph server on a specific port
whyanchor viewgraph --no-open                 # start the server without launching a browser
whyanchor connect --agent claude,cursor       # only wire up some agents
whyanchor connect --command "whyanchor mcp"   # override how the server is launched
```

---

## The knowledge graph

```bash
whyanchor viewgraph
```

Every note is already connected to other things: the files and symbols it's anchored to, the
tags it shares with other notes, and — when one note supersedes another — the note it replaced.
`viewgraph` draws that as an actual graph instead of leaving you to trace it through `list` output
by hand.

It's a small Next.js app, bundled inside whyanchor itself: `viewgraph` starts it on `127.0.0.1`
(picking a free port automatically) and opens your browser to it. The server listens on the loopback
interface only, so nothing on your network can reach it — the page fetches its data from a local API
route that reads straight from `.memory/entries/` — but it genuinely is a running server, not a file
you're opening directly, and it keeps running in your terminal until you press Ctrl+C. If you ask
for a `--port` that's already taken, it says so and exits instead of starting. The page has:

- **Memory, file, and tag nodes**, force-directed and colored by type, with a memory node's color
  showing its `stale`/`superseded` status
- **Pan, zoom, and drag** a node to reposition it
- **A search box** that dims everything except nodes matching what you type
- **Filters** by node type and by status (superseded notes are hidden by default, to keep the
  graph focused on what's still current)
- **A detail panel** — click any node to see its full body, refs, and tags, and jump to
  whatever it's connected to
- **Auto-refresh** — it polls for new captures every few seconds, so a decision an agent just
  saved shows up without you restarting anything (nodes you've arranged stay where they are)

```bash
whyanchor viewgraph --tag billing   # open filtered to one tag's notes (clear it in the page)
whyanchor viewgraph --port 5000 --no-open   # run on a specific port, don't launch a browser
```

Every fetch reads `.memory/entries/` fresh — there's no separate index or cache to keep in sync,
so the graph is always as current as your last capture.

---

## How AI agents use it

`whyanchor connect` sets this up for you. Here is what it actually configures.

**The config files it writes:**

| Agent | File | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` | JSON, picked up automatically when the project opens |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Same JSON shape |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/config.toml` | TOML — a different format. Also needs `codex trust` on the repo once. |

**The six tools your agent gets:**

| Tool | When the agent uses it |
| --- | --- |
| `get_memory_for_file` | Before editing a file — "what do I need to know about this one?" Takes a repo-relative or absolute path (either slash direction); `file#symbol` narrows to that symbol's notes plus whole-file notes. |
| `search_memory` | Before a big decision — "has this already been decided?" Ranked locally by relevance (title/tags/refs/body), no embeddings or network calls involved. |
| `get_related_memory` | To pull in other notes connected to one it already has, via shared files, shared tags, or a supersedes chain — the same relationships `whyanchor viewgraph` draws as edges. Given a superseded note, it returns the note that replaced it. |
| `get_memory_entry` | To read one note in full, including what it supersedes and what superseded it |
| `list_stale_memory` | To check whether a note can still be trusted |
| `capture_memory` | To save a new decision during your conversation. Pass `supersedes` to replace a stale note; the reply warns about refs it couldn't resolve. |

If the MCP server is started somewhere with no `.memory/` (usually an agent launching it outside the
project directory), every tool returns an error saying so, rather than an empty list that looks
like "nothing recorded".

Both `search_memory` and `get_related_memory` return compact summaries (title, tags, refs, a
one-line preview), not full bodies — keeping an agent's context usage low even as the store grows.
Every call reads straight from `.memory/entries/` with no cache in between, so a capture made
one second ago is visible to the very next tool call, from any connected agent.

### The part people get wrong

Registering the tools only makes them **available**. It does not make an agent **use** them. An
agent will not think to check your notes unless something tells it to.

That is why `whyanchor connect` also writes a short instruction block into `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`:

> - **Before editing a file**, call `get_memory_for_file` with its path.
> - **Before a non-obvious choice**, call `search_memory` first.
> - **When you land on a decision worth remembering**, call `capture_memory`.

Without that block, the tools sit there unused. With it, the agent checks your notes on its own.

### Agent-written notes are safe

When an agent calls `capture_memory`, it writes a normal file into `.memory/`. It **never commits
anything**. The note shows up in `git diff` like any other change, and you approve it the same way
you approve code. Nothing enters your project's history without you looking at it.

---

## Staleness detection: the main idea

This is the part that other note-taking approaches do not do.

When you save a note, the tool records a **fingerprint**: a hash of the exact function or file you
anchored to, plus the current git commit. Later, `whyanchor check` recomputes that fingerprint and
compares.

![Staleness detection flow: the four-level check, from missing refs to a fresh fingerprint match](docs/diagrams/staleness-detection-flow.svg)

<sub>[Diagram source](docs/diagrams/staleness-detection-flow.mmd)</sub>

Why four levels instead of just "stale / not stale"? Because a file-level check cries wolf. If
someone edits a different function in the same file, a naive tool flags your note and you learn to
ignore the warnings. Anchoring to `src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount` means you are only alerted
when **that function** actually changed.

Real example from this repo: a refactor split one function into two. `whyanchor check` flagged the
note pointing at the old one, the note got superseded with a corrected anchor, and the
documentation stayed true. That is the loop working.

**No AI is involved in this check.** It is hashes and git history — fast, free, and it runs on every
commit. It tells you *that* something changed, not *whether the reasoning still holds*. A human
still makes that call.

Two things it deliberately ignores, because they aren't changes to the code:

- **Line endings and a BOM.** Code is normalized to LF before hashing, so a note captured on macOS
  isn't flagged the moment a teammate (or CI) checks the repo out on Windows with `core.autocrlf`.
- **A rewritten or shallow history.** If the commit a note was captured on no longer exists (rebase,
  squash, `--depth 1` clone), the content comparison still runs and the report says the commit
  count is unavailable, instead of claiming "0 commits".

Notes captured by whyanchor 0.2.0 and earlier sometimes fingerprinted only part of a symbol (for example
just the signature of a function with a destructured parameter). When that part is unchanged,
`check` reports the note as `[low]` with a hint to supersede it — which re-anchors it to the whole
symbol — rather than calling it changed.

## Compared with existing tools

Honest version, researched September 2026.

### Free things people already use

| Approach | What it gives you | Where it falls short |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hand-written `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`** | Free, in git, read by nearly every AI tool. Genuinely solves ~60% of this problem with zero setup. | One growing file. Nothing tells you when a line has gone out of date. Everything gets loaded every time, whether relevant or not. |
| **Comments in the code** | Right next to the code | Nobody writes "we rejected Mongo because…" in a comment. Comments explain *what*, rarely *why not*. |
| **A wiki / Notion page** | Nice to read | Lives outside the repo, so the agent never sees it and it drifts silently. |
| **basic-memory** | Markdown notes over MCP — close to this design | General-purpose notes, not anchored to code, so no drift detection. |
| **projectmem** (MIT, free) | Native MCP across major agents, append-only event log, **and it ships staleness detection too** | The closest thing to this tool. If it fits you, use it — see the honesty note below. |

### Commercial tools

| Tool | What it is | Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swimm** | Docs that flag drift as a PR check — the paid version of the staleness idea | ~$39/month per team (≤10 users) |
| **Greptile** | Answers questions about your code, AI code review | Free tier (50 reviews/mo) → $30/seat/mo + $1/review |
| **Sourcegraph Cody** | Code intelligence and search | ~$59/seat/mo, enterprise only |
| **mem0** | Hosted memory API for AI apps | Free (10k memories) → $19/mo → $249/mo |
| **Zep / Graphiti** | Temporal knowledge graph for agent memory | Free (10k msgs) → ~$99–125/mo |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code completion and chat | $19/seat/mo → $39/seat/mo |

The code-search tools (Greptile, Sourcegraph) are **not competitors** — they answer *"what does
this code do?"*. They do not hold *"why did we choose this, and what did we reject?"*. Run them
alongside this, not instead of it.

---

## What makes this one different

Six concrete design choices:

1. **Anchored to symbols, not files.** A note points at `pricing.ts#calculateDiscount`, not just
   `pricing.ts`. Unrelated edits in the same file do not trigger false alarms.
2. **Four staleness levels, not a yes/no flag.** "Your function changed" and "someone else edited
   this file" are different situations and get different warnings.
3. **Delivered two ways.** Generated into `CLAUDE.md` for agents with no MCP support, *and* served
   live over MCP for agents that have it. You are not locked to one delivery method.
4. **Plain markdown, one file per note.** Open them in any editor. `git diff`, `git blame` and
   merges all work normally. If you delete this tool tomorrow, your notes are still readable.
5. **One command to set up across three agents.** `whyanchor connect` handles the config *and* the
   instructions that make an agent actually use it.
6. **A visual map of how your decisions connect.** `whyanchor viewgraph` turns the refs, tags, and
   supersedes chains you already write into an explorable graph — see [The knowledge
   graph](#the-knowledge-graph).

### An honest note

This is not a category-defining invention, and you should know that before investing in it.

**projectmem** is free, MIT-licensed, and already ships local staleness detection across the same
agents. A plain hand-written `CLAUDE.md` gets you most of the way for zero effort. If either of
those fits your situation, use them — the goal is that your decisions survive, not that you use
this particular tool.

What this one offers is symbol-level anchoring, the four-level check, dual delivery, one command
to wire it all up, and a graph view to see it all connected. Whether that is worth switching for
depends entirely on the next section.

## When this tool is useful (and when it is not)

Five honest tests. **If you answer "no" to most of these, you do not need this tool** — a
hand-written `CLAUDE.md` will serve you better with less ceremony.

| Test | Worth it when | Skip it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Are the reasons invisible?** | The *why* cannot be recovered by reading the code — "Legal requires 30%", "we tried X, it deadlocked" | Your choices are obvious from the code itself |
| **Does the code move?** | Files change often enough that written context goes stale | The codebase is basically frozen — a wiki is fine |
| **How long is the gap?** | Months pass between a decision and the next person needing it | You will still remember next week |
| **How many minds touch it?** | Several developers — **or many fresh AI sessions, each starting from zero** | One person, one continuous train of thought |
| **What does a mistake cost?** | A broken contract, an outage, a week of rework | Twenty minutes of rework |

**That fourth row matters most today.** You do not need a big team to have a memory problem
anymore. If you work alone but run dozens of AI agent sessions, every one of those sessions is a
new person who knows nothing. That is the same problem as onboarding a teammate, over and over.

### The honest failure mode

The thing that kills tools like this is not bugs. It is that **nobody writes the notes**.

So test it properly. Pick **one** real project — not all of them. Use it for three weeks. Then ask:

> Are notes getting written without me forcing myself to write them?

If yes, it is earning its place. If you are nagging yourself, the friction won, and no amount of
polish will fix that. Better to find that out in three weeks on one project than in six months
across ten.

## The memory file format

One markdown file per note, in `.memory/entries/`. Nothing proprietary.

```markdown
---
id: mem_a8AwCAoR
title: Enterprise discount is 30% by contract, not a guess
date: 2026-09-21
author: you@example.com
tags: [pricing, legal]
refs: [src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount]
supersedes: null
status: active
commit: 8f3a1c2
fingerprint:
  src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount: { hash: 7ac9f1e2b3d4c5a6, kind: symbol }
last_checked: null
---

Legal signed off on 30% in the 2026 MSA template. Do not change this for
conversion experiments without contract review.
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Permanent identifier for this note |
| `title` | One-line summary, shown in lists and reports |
| `date` / `author` | Who wrote it and when — taken from your git config |
| `tags` | Free-form labels; the first one decides which heading a note is listed under in the generated files |
| `refs` | The anchors: `path/to/file.ts` or `path/to/file.ts#functionName` |
| `supersedes` | The `id` of a note this one replaces |
| `status` | `active`, `stale`, or `superseded` |
| `commit` | The commit you were on when you wrote it — the baseline for checks |
| `fingerprint` | Hash of the anchored code at the time of writing (`kind: file` when a symbol couldn't be found and the whole file is watched) |
| `last_checked` | When `whyanchor check --write` last looked at it |

**Anchoring supports two shapes:**

- `src/pricing.ts` — watches the whole file
- `src/pricing.ts#calculateDiscount` — watches only that function or class

Symbol detection covers functions, methods, classes, interfaces, types, enums and constants in brace
languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C#, Rust, Kotlin…) — including multi-line signatures,
destructured parameters, Allman-style braces and TypeScript overloads — and indentation languages
(Python, Ruby), including multi-line `def` signatures. If a symbol cannot be found, `capture` warns
and falls back to watching the whole file rather than failing, and `check` keeps comparing that
note as a whole file.

Entries are hand-editable: unquoted YAML dates like the `date: 2026-09-21` above are fine.

The generated files are checked in on purpose. Anyone who clones this repo gets the memory
tooling working immediately, with no setup.

`graph-app/` is the opposite: its `.next/` build output is gitignored (like `dist/`) but still
needs to ship in the npm package, since `viewgraph` runs the prebuilt app, not `next dev`. `npm run
build` runs `tsc` and then `next build graph-app` in that order — the app's API route imports the
already-compiled `../dist/core/*.js`, not `../src`, so `dist/` has to exist first. An `.npmignore`
(which replaces `.gitignore` for packing purposes) makes sure the gitignored `.next` output still
gets published.

## Development

```bash
npm run build       # compile TypeScript into dist/, then build the graph-app Next.js UI
npm run typecheck   # type check without emitting
npm test            # run the test suite
npm run dev -- list # run a command straight from source, no build
```

**163 tests across 13 files.** The staleness tests are not mocked — they create real temporary git
repos, make real commits (including CRLF checkouts and rewritten history), and assert that each of
the four levels comes out right. The MCP tests drive the server through a real MCP client, the same
protocol an agent speaks. That is how the
two nastiest bugs in this codebase were caught before release:

- A function whose signature spanned six lines was fingerprinted from its declaration line only,
  so changes to its body went undetected.
- A config-merging routine matched a TOML table with a regex that stopped at the first `[` — which
  is inside the `args = [...]` value — corrupting the file it was supposed to update.

Both were the same underlying mistake: matching text by substring instead of by structure.

## What is deliberately not built

Saying no is part of the design.

| Not built | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Reading raw AI session transcripts** | The file formats are undocumented and change with every vendor update. The signal is poor — a model cannot tell a real decision from an idea you abandoned. |
| **A custom secret scanner** | Use gitleaks or trufflehog. Never write your own. |
| **An AI-powered "does this note still make sense" check** | Costs money on every run and produces uncertain answers. The free hash check tells you *what changed*; you decide what it means. |
| **A hosted dashboard, team accounts, billing** | That is a different product with servers, security and a support burden. This one stays local and free. |
| **Automatic commits** | Nothing enters your git history without you reviewing it. That is the whole trust model. |

markdown, and they will outlive this tool.

memory check re-hashes each ref's symbol/file and counts commits touching that file since capture (src/core/staleness.ts). A hash mismatch is a high-confidence flag; commits with no hash change is low-confidence. This keeps the free tier LLM-free and matches the two-tier design in the SaaS strategy doc without needing the paid slow tier.

Chosen over a single JSON or SQLite store so git handles merge, diff and blame for free. Small per-entry files also conflict far less than one shared file when two people capture at the same time, and they stay readable and editable in any editor without the tool installed. The schema lives in src/core/schema.ts and every read and write is validated against it, so a hand-edited entry fails loudly instead of silently corrupting the store.

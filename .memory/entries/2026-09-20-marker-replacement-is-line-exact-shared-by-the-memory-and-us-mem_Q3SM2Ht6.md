upsertMarkedSection replaces only the text between a start and end marker, matching each marker as a full line rather than a substring — an entry's rendered body can legitimately contain the literal marker text, and indexOf matched that instead of the real closing marker, truncating CLAUDE.md mid-sentence. Both CLAUDE.md blocks use it: the generated memory block (ctx-memory:start) and the agent usage block written by memory connect (ctx-memory:usage:start), which is why they can coexist and survive each other's regeneration. upsertMemorySection is now a thin wrapper kept for the existing call sites.

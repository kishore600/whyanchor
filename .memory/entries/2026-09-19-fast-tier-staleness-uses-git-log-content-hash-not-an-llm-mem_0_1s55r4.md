memory check re-hashes each ref's symbol/file and counts commits touching that file since capture (src/core/staleness.ts). A hash mismatch is a high-confidence flag; commits with no hash change is low-confidence. Symbol extraction now searches up to 50 lines ahead for the opening brace (src/core/fingerprint.ts) so multi-line signatures fingerprint the whole body, not just the declaration line.
